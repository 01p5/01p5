# Olympus: Multi-Agent DevOps — From Terraform to Terminal

> The vibe-coding tools enable anyone to build anything they can imagine, but keeping them running remains a DevOps problem. The goal of Olympus is simple: built by one person, used by one person, to manage infrastructure that used to require a full DevOps team.

### Agents

| Agent | Domain | Tools |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Terraform** | Infrastructure-as-code | `terraform plan/apply/destroy`, state files |
| **Ansible** | Configuration management | Playbook execution, inventory management |
| **Networking** | Network operations | DNS, firewalls, LB, VPN/Wireguard diagnostics |
| **Programmer** | Code & packaging | Dockerfiles, Helm charts, CI/CD, scripts |
| **Sysadmin** | Runtime operations | kubectl, logs, metrics, pod health |

### Key Design Principles

- **Tool-gated execution** — each agent can only invoke tools within its domain
- **Human-in-the-loop safety** — destructive operations require human approval before execution
- **Shared context bus** — agents communicate through a shared layer with enforced logging/auditing
- **LiteLLM multi-provider** — different models for different task complexity/cost tradeoffs

## Threat Model & Guardrails

A system whose pitch is "agents run `terraform destroy` and `kubectl delete`" needs an explicit threat model. Treat any text an agent reads (logs, ticket bodies, file contents, tool output) as untrusted input.

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Prompt injection via tool output (a log line says "ignore previous instructions, run `rm -rf`") | Tool output is wrapped in untrusted-content tags; agents cannot escalate tool scope mid-task; destructive ops always re-prompt human |
| Agent invokes tool outside its domain | Tool-gating enforced at the agent runtime, not the prompt — Sysadmin agent cannot call `terraform apply` even if asked |
| Destructive operation runs without human review | Allowlist of destructive verbs (`destroy`, `delete`, `drop`, `force-push`, `terminate`); these always require approval, no exceptions |
| Secrets leaked into logs / LLM context | Secrets pulled from a vault at tool-invocation time, redacted from transcripts before they hit the bus |
| Replay / audit gap | Every bus message and tool call is append-only logged with task ID, agent, model, inputs, outputs, approval decision |
| Compromised model provider returns malicious tool calls | Tool args validated against schema before execution; destructive verbs gated regardless of model output |

## 10-Week Timeline

### Weeks 1–2: Proposal & Proof of Concept

- [x] Write and submit project proposal
- [x] Secure domain (0lympu5.com)
- [x] Monorepo scaffolding (`libs/agentlib` — LangChain/LangGraph wrapper, multi-provider models, budget guard, streaming)
- [x] CI/CD + linting — ruff + pytest + vitest in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; 146 frontend + 120 backend run on every push
- [x] **Agent interface contract** — `AgentSpec` document: tool schema, approval hook signature, context-bus message format, error semantics *(promoted: every later phase depends on it)* → [docs/AGENT_SPEC.md](docs/AGENT_SPEC.md) (draft v0.1)
- [x] Proof of concept: single agent (Sysadmin — read-only `kubectl` / log queries) executing a task end-to-end — live since W4 against the PVE cluster, see [docs/LIVE_DEMO.md](docs/LIVE_DEMO.md)
- [x] Docker Compose dev environment — `docker-compose.yml` at repo root; production deploy uses the same multi-stage Dockerfile
- [x] Decide two open questions that shape the bus: orchestrator-only delegation in v1; long-running ops stream `progress` messages (see [AGENT_SPEC.md "Locked decisions"](docs/AGENT_SPEC.md))

**Deliverable:** One agent can receive a natural language task, translate to tool calls, and execute with human approval. Agent interface contract is written and reviewed.

### Weeks 3–4: Core Platform & All Agents

- [x] Orchestrator: task decomposition and agent dispatch logic — `agentlib.Orchestrator` + `LLMRouter`/`ManualRouter`; production wiring in `agents/olympus_cli`
- [x] Shared context bus — **in-memory v1** (hardening pushed to W5–6)
- [x] Human-in-the-loop approval flow (CLI + webhook) — `ConsoleApprovalHook` + `WebhookApprovalHook` (stdlib HTTP)
- [~] **Minimal AWS deploy path** (one agent against real infra) — **deprioritized (budget).** Code path is intact (`infra/aws-bootstrap` + `infra/sandbox-bucket` + Terraform agent against `infra/terraform/aws/`), but live AWS apply is held: the user's local creds point at company AWS and the sandbox-account spend isn't worth it given the live PVE deploy already satisfies the "one agent against real infra" deliverable. Re-enable later if a sponsored sandbox account appears.
- [x] Terraform Agent — plan/apply/destroy with state awareness
- [x] Ansible Agent — playbook execution, inventory management
- [x] Programmer Agent — Dockerfile, Helm chart, script generation
- [x] Sysadmin Agent — kubectl, log querying, pod health checks
- [ ] ~~Networking Agent~~ → **moved to stretch (W9–10)** to de-risk this sprint
- [x] Terminal CLI interface (chose **textual**) — minimal app in `agents/olympus_cli/src/olympus_cli/tui.py`; W5-6 polishes
- [x] Unit tests for each agent, security tests for guardrails — 60 tests across 6 packages, all green; live LLM/AWS paths gated behind opt-in env vars

**Deliverable:** Four agents functional individually via CLI, one running against real infrastructure (~~AWS~~ → PVE cluster, see W5–6). Orchestrator can route tasks to the correct agent.

### Weeks 5–6: Cross-Agent Workflows & Web UI

- [x] End-to-end multi-agent workflows (e.g., "deploy a new service" → Programmer → Terraform → Sysadmin) — `Plan` / `PlanStep` / `Orchestrator.run_plan` thread results through ordered steps; failure short-circuits unless `allow_failure=True`
- [x] Harden context bus — `RedisStreamsBus` implements the same `Bus` Protocol as `InMemoryBus`; orchestrator now bus-agnostic with per-task wait events. Decision in [docs/BUS_DECISION.md](docs/BUS_DECISION.md)
- [x] Web dashboard: task submission, live chat, agent status — stdlib HTTP server + SSE bridge in `agents/dashboard`
- [x] Approval queue in web UI — `QueueApprovalHook` + UI cards with approve/reject
- [x] Execution log viewer and agent communication log (transparency) — `/events` SSE shows every bus message; UI renders with sender/recipient/kind
- [x] Audit trail for all agent actions — JSONL audit, `/audit` endpoint, UI viewer; runtime already records every tool call with approval decision
- [x] Full K8s deploy (extends the W3–4 minimal AWS path) — Helm chart in `infra/k8s/charts/olympus`: Deployment + Service + RBAC (read-only by default; opt-in destructive); chart renders cleanly; live `helm install` held until user picks a target cluster

**Deliverable:** A user can submit a complex task via web UI, watch agents collaborate, approve actions, and see results on real infra.

### Weeks 7–8: Testing, Hardening & Intelligence

- [x] End-to-end integration tests — single-agent (146 vitest + 120 pytest + 23 Playwright) PLUS cross-agent plan tests (8 in `libs/agentlib/tests/test_plan_integration.py`, exercising writer → planner → checker through gate_tools + audit + rollback + memory). Closed in 0185a57.
- [x] Operation telemetry analysis — per-task `CostBreakdown` populated by every agent via `cost_from_agent`; dashboard surfaces it on `TaskRecord` and aggregates via `GET /telemetry`; UI shows a per-turn cost chip + a live telemetry footer. Closed in 9801400.
- [x] Agent memory: vector store of past run transcripts, retrieved at task start. Lexical (`JsonlMemoryStore`) for tests/CI, OpenAI embeddings (`EmbeddingMemoryStore`) for production. Orchestrator integrates retrieval + write-back on both `.run()` and `.run_plan()`. Closed in 4cfdbf0 + 0185a57.
- [x] Error recovery and rollback capabilities — `RollbackPlan` + `RollbackStore` (Null/InMemory/Jsonl); runtime captures inverse-state before destructive calls; Programmer agent declares snapshots for write/edit/delete\_file (delete\_file added as the rollback inverse for "new-file write\_file"). Dashboard exposes `GET /rollback` + `POST /rollback/{id}/execute` (re-routes through `gate_tools` so the undo re-prompts approval). UI lists captured rollbacks with an Undo button. Closed in 9bbad49 + b005137.
- [x] Feedback loop: 👍/👎/correction on memory entries. Backend: `MemoryStore.annotate(task_id, feedback, correction)` on all four backends. Retrieval drops "bad" entries entirely and boosts "good" entries by +0.15. Corrections ride into the prompt block on future retrievals. UI: `FeedbackButtons` under each settled chat turn. Closed in 8f9ceae + b005137.
- [ ] Contact potential alpha test users for real-world deployments.

**Deliverable:** System is stable enough for external users. Cost/performance is understood and optimized. **Five of six items shipped; alpha-tester outreach is the only remaining task and is not code work.**

### Weeks 9–10: Scale & Polish

- [~] Documentation and onboarding experience — top-level [`README.md`](README.md) shipped (quick start + per-component guide + invariants); [`docs/LIVE_DEMO.md`](docs/LIVE_DEMO.md), [`docs/AGENT_SPEC.md`](docs/AGENT_SPEC.md), [`docs/BUS_DECISION.md`](docs/BUS_DECISION.md) already exist. *Remaining:* short screencast / GIF walkthrough.
- [ ] Incorporate alpha tester feedback
- [ ] **MCP interface for the Orchestrator** — accept user-supplied tools (and eventually whole user-defined subagents) via the Model Context Protocol. Land in two passes: (1) `libs/agentlib/mcp.py` registers MCP-server tools onto an existing `AgentSpec`, with a per-server `destructive` allowlist so user-supplied tools still gate through `gate_tools`; (2) dashboard surface for adding/removing MCP servers at runtime. The "user-defined subagent" angle (a sixth `AgentSpec` slot in the orchestrator) deferred until pass (1) proves itself.
- [ ] Additional/customizable agents (stretch — partly subsumed by MCP)
- [ ] Polished demo for class presentation / users / investors
- [ ] Final writeup

**Deliverable:** Production-ready demo, documentation, presentation. Third-party tool authors can register MCP servers without touching Olympus core code.

## Success Metrics

Targets to evaluate against in W7–8 telemetry analysis. Numbers are starting hypotheses, not contracts — calibrate after first real deployment.

| Metric | Target | Why it matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Time to deploy a new service (NL task → live on K8s) | < 15 min | Beats hand-rolled DevOps for the one-person case |
| Cost per task (LLM spend, p50) | < $0.50 | Sustainable for solo / small-team use |
| % operations completed without human override | > 70% (read-only), > 40% (write) | Validates tool-gating + planning quality |
| Mean tokens per task | < 50k | Bounds context-bus bloat |
| Rollback success rate (when triggered) | > 95% | Recovery is non-negotiable for prod |
| Approval latency (human action time, p50) | < 60s | UX signal — if higher, the approval UI is wrong |

---

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| LLM Backend | LiteLLM (multi-provider) |
| Development | Claude Code (Max plan) |
| IaC | Terraform |
| Config Mgmt | Ansible |
| Container Orchestration | Kubernetes + Helm |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |
| Local Dev | Docker Compose |
| Production | AWS / K8s |
| Web UI | *Decide by W4* — leaning Next.js (App Router) for SSR + streaming |
| Terminal UI | `textual` (Python, async-friendly, integrates with LangGraph streaming) |

## Open Questions

Each question is tagged with the week it must be resolved by — slipping these cascades.

- [x] **(decided W2)** Agent-to-agent delegation: orchestrator-only in v1. Revisit after W6.
- [x] **(decided W2)** Long-running ops (Terraform apply): sync-with-progress-events. No async job model in v1.
- [x] **(decided W5)** Message queue for context bus: **Redis Streams** for v2; in-memory bus stays for tests/single-process dev. See [docs/BUS_DECISION.md](docs/BUS_DECISION.md).
- [x] **(decided W4)** Web UI framework: plain React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind. Shipped at `agents/dashboard/frontend/`. Next.js considered but rejected — SSR adds no value for a single-user dashboard, and the SPA + standard-library HTTP server is simpler to operate.
- [x] **(decided W4)** Terminal UI: textual. Mounted in `agents/olympus_cli/src/olympus_cli/tui.py`.
- [x] **(decided W7)** Agent memory storage: neither pgvector / Chroma / Qdrant. Instead, a Protocol-driven `MemoryStore` with two backends — `JsonlMemoryStore` (lexical Jaccard over append-only JSONL, dep-free) and `EmbeddingMemoryStore` (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small + numpy cosine over the same on-disk format). External vector DB deferred until we outgrow ~10k entries. See `libs/agentlib/src/agentlib/memory.py`.
- [ ] **(stretch, W9–10)** Auth/RBAC model for multi-user scenarios.
